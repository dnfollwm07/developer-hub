## On-Call Automation Platform (Ops + AI)

**Role:** Lead for Problem Solving and Solution Implementation  
**Duration:** Dec 2023 – Jun 2024  
**Company:** Meituan (Beijing Sankuai Online Technology Co., Ltd.)  
**Tech Stack:** RAG, Vector Embeddings, Semantic Search, Node.js, Real-time Dashboards, Monitoring Systems

---

### Overview

Built an internal orchestration platform to unify alerts, monitoring, and resolution workflows for on-call operations. The system leverages **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** technology to convert past incidents into a searchable knowledge corpus, significantly reducing manual troubleshooting time and improving operational safety.

---

### Problem Statement

The on-call management at the team was chaotic, with no effective tracking system. This led to:
- **Delays** in incident response
- **Inefficiencies** in problem resolution
- **Increased operational costs**
- **Lack of traceability** for incidents and resolutions
- **High manual consultation workload** for troubleshooting

---

### Solution Architecture

#### **Unified Orchestration Platform**
- Built a centralized platform to unify alerts, monitoring, and resolution workflows
- Integrated with existing monitoring and alerting systems
- Real-time dashboards for incident visibility and tracking
- Automated anomaly detection to improve response speed

#### **RAG-Based Incident Knowledge System**
- Leveraged **RAG technology** to convert past incidents into a searchable corpus
- Used **vector embeddings** for semantic search across incident history
- Enabled natural language queries to find similar past incidents and solutions
- Automated knowledge base updates from resolved incidents

#### **Operational Improvements**
- Improved traceability through comprehensive logging and dashboards
- Reduced manual consultation by enabling self-service incident resolution
- Streamlined on-call workflows with automated routing and prioritization

---

### Technical Implementation

#### **RAG Architecture**
- **Vector Embeddings:** Converted incident descriptions, error messages, and resolutions into embeddings
- **Semantic Search:** Enabled similarity-based retrieval of relevant past incidents
- **Knowledge Base:** Maintained a continuously updated corpus of incident-solution pairs
- **Query Interface:** Natural language interface for searching incident knowledge

#### **Monitoring & Alerting Integration**
- Integrated with company's internal monitoring systems
- Real-time alert aggregation and prioritization
- Automated anomaly detection using statistical models
- Dashboard visualization for incident trends and patterns

#### **Workflow Automation**
- Automated incident routing based on severity and type
- Prioritization algorithms for efficient resource allocation
- Post-incident analysis and knowledge extraction
- Automated knowledge base updates

---

### Key Achievements

- **37% reduction** in operational load
- **50% reduction** in manual consultation workload
- Improved **traceability** and response speed through dashboards
- **Automated anomaly detection** reducing time-to-detection
- Enhanced **operational safety** through knowledge reuse

---

### Impact

The platform transformed on-call operations from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, automated system. By leveraging AI and RAG technology, the team was able to:
- Respond to incidents faster with automated detection and routing
- Reduce operational overhead through self-service knowledge access
- Improve system reliability by learning from past incidents
- Scale operations without proportional increase in manual effort
