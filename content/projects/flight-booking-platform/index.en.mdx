## High-Reliability Flight Booking Platform

**Role:** Lead Developer for 100+ Feature Enhancements  
**Duration:** Jul 2022 – Jun 2024  
**Company:** Meituan (Beijing Sankuai Online Technology Co., Ltd.)  
**Tech Stack:** React Native, Vue.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, REST API

---

### Overview

Led system modernization across frontend and backend integration for a mission-critical flight booking platform serving **1M+ daily users**. The platform handles flight search, booking, and payment flows across Meituan App and WeChat Mini Programs, requiring high reliability, correctness, and low latency.

### Key Achievements

#### **Performance Optimization**
- Optimized API pipelines and request strategies using **lazy loading**, **pre-requests**, and **request merging**
- Improved **initial render speed by 16.7%** through bundle size reduction, tree-shaking, and resource preloading
- Boosted **booking conversion rate by 3%** by reducing time-to-interactive and improving user experience

#### **System Modernization**
- Modernized legacy modules into **scalable architectures** with modular design patterns
- Reduced **long-term maintenance cost by 30%** through code refactoring and reusable component development
- Developed **20+ reusable business components** (buttons, tab navigation, display cards) to reduce team workload

#### **Cross-Platform Consistency**
- Partnered with platform department to unify user experience across **Meituan App** and **WeChat Mini Programs**
- Ensured consistent behaviors and data flow across different platforms
- Implemented platform-specific optimizations while maintaining code reusability

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### **First Contentful Paint (FCP) Optimization**

**Challenge:** Continuously reducing time-to-interactive for the booking flow under high traffic.

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Bundle Size Reduction**
   - Implemented **tree-shaking** to eliminate unused code
   - Used Babel plugin to transform `import _ from 'lodash'` into efficient module imports like `import throttle from 'lodash/throttle'`
   - Replaced larger third-party libraries (e.g., **moment.js → day.js**) to minimize dependency sizes
   - Used image compression tools (TinyPNG) to reduce initial resource load

2. **Preloading Strategy**
   - Utilized **PN file** mechanism for dynamic resource loading with listeners
   - Issued requests early and synchronized them with main bundle load
   - Implemented **request merging** using interceptors to avoid redundant requests

3. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Configured **FlatList** and **VirtualizedList** attributes (`initialNumToRender`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`) to optimize initial render
   - Pre-calculated cell heights to improve list rendering efficiency
   - Used **page preloading** and **RAM bundle mechanism** to preload next page's bundle and reuse short-lived engine instances

### Impact

- **100+ features** developed and launched over two years
- **16.7% improvement** in page load times
- **3% increase** in booking conversion rate
- **30% reduction** in future maintenance time
- **20+ reusable components** reducing team development workload
